# Mobius Strip Modeling

## How I Structured the Code

I built the Mobius strip script as `MobiusStrip`, a Python class that is single and tidy. Just tell the object of its radius (`R`), width (`w`), and resolution (`n`) for smoothness, to make it. Immediately, the class sets up a meshgrid, which is a grid of points covering the surface. This setup uses the classic parametric equations of the Mobius strip. For each single point, it does calculate all of the 3D coordinates (`x, y, z`).

Three main tools exist within the class.
- `surface_area()`: The whole surface area gets computed.
- The Mobius strip’s edge gets found by `edge_length()`. The single edge's length gets returned.
- `plot()`: A colorbar does accompany the colorful gradient while the Mobius strip draws in 3D.

A Mobius strip is known as a curved and twisted surface, so then it cannot have a simple area formula. It is not that you can use just one simple formula for what its area is because of all of this. I used numerical integration in its place.
- In computing of how the surface changes, the code gets partial derivatives with respect to `u` and `v` at every single point on the meshgrid.
- These derivatives show how the surface is “stretched” in each direction. Area for each tiny patch is provided. It is their cross product that gives it.
- The script sums up (integrates) all these tiny areas across the whole strip along with it uses Simpson’s rule (from `scipy.integrate.simps`) for accuracy.

- **Getting of the math right:** The Mobius strip twists as it goes around, and therefore it was easy for one to mix up the parametric equations or also their derivatives. I did double-check the math especially for the cross products.
- **Balancing detail and speed:** Higher resolution (`n`) gives a smoother, more accurate result, but can slow things down. It was a bit of a balancing act to make things look good but compute fast.
- **Visualization:** By default, matplotlib overlays black mesh lines, which can make the surface look “dirty” or less smooth. I set `edgecolor='none'` and used a plasma color gradient for a clean look. I also added a colorbar for clarity.
- **Tracing the edge:** Since the Mobius strip has just one edge that loops with a twist, tracing and joining both “sides” into a single edge for the length calculation took some careful array handling.

In the end, the script is short, modular, and easy to use—just call a couple of methods and you get both the math and a beautiful plot!
